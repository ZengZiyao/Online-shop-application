                <h2>We, Anonymous</h2>
                <p>C.N. Williamson and E.E. “Colonel” Dickie began their business careers in the “vehicle and harness”
                    business in Bryan,
                    Texas. In 1918 they and a few friends established the U.S. Overall Company. Then, in 1922, C. Don
                    Williamson joined with
                    his father and cousin to buy 100% of the overall company on a one-third-each basis and renamed it
                    Williamson-Dickie
                    Manufacturing Company. <br>
                    From its early years, Williamson-Dickie enjoyed steady growth which was slowed down only by the
                    Great Depression, and
                    during World War II, the company produced millions of uniforms for the nation’s armed forces. In
                    converting to civilian
                    production after the war, C. Don Williamson began a strategy of geographical expansion and
                    established new production
                    facilities, warehouses, and sales territories throughout the United States. In the late 1950s,
                    Williamson-Dickie became
                    an international company by expanding into the European market and the Middle Eastern market – where
                    Texas oilmen
                    introduced the Dickies brand to Middle Eastern oil fields.
